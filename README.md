# createAuthKeys
The program is part of software programs and is not standalone executable. Therefore, you will need to write some additional code to run it. 
The code is for representative matter and was modified as well as simplified due to copy rights - as such it differs from the original program.

The program start with function <generateKey> in the file 'generateKeys.py'.

The program receive the orders written in a string and according to the mode creates inserts for users, where the data is inserted into three DB tables.

IMPORTANT: The code is complex and one of old ones. Look also repository 'createButtons' where the program is similar but with optimizing code.
